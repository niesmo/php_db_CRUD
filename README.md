php_db_CRUD
===========

This is a class that I wrote, so when I want to use databases, I dont need to use native database calls.

In this class, there are functions that you can use to insert, delete, update, select from the database configued in a more user friendly way.


I made this files before I was familiar with any of the PHP frameworks. (Obviously)
